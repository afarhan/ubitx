## REVISION RECORD
0.25
  - Beta Version Released
    http://www.hamskey.com/2018/01/release-beta-version-of-cat-support.html
  - Added CAT Protocol for uBITX
  - Modified the default usb carrier value used when the setting is wrong.
  - Fixed a routine to repair when the CAT protocol was interrupted.

0.24
  - Program optimization
    reduce usage ram rate (string with M() optins)
  - Optimized CAT protocol for wsjt-x, fldigi

0.23
  - added delay_background() , replace almost delay() to delay_background for prevent timeout
  - cat library compatible with FT-817 Command 
    switch VFOA / VFOB, 
    Read Write CW Speed
    Read Write CW Delay Time
    Read Write CW Pitch (with sidetone)
    All of these can be controlled by Hamradio deluxe.

  - modified cat libray function for protocol for CAT communication is not broken in CW or TX mode
  - Ability to change CW Delay
  - Added Dial Lock function
  - Add functions CW Start dely (TX -> CW interval)
  - Automatic storage of VFO frequency
    It was implemented by storing it only once when the frequency stays 10 seconds or more after the change.
    (protect eeprom life)

  
0.22
  - fixed screen Update Problem
  - Frequency Display Problem - Problems occur below 1Mhz
  - added function Enhanced CAT communication
  - replace ubitx_cat.ino to cat_libs.ino
  - Save mode when switching to VFOA / VFOB


0.21
  - fixed the cw side tone configuration.
  - Fix the error that the frequency is over.
  - fixed frequency display (alignment, point) 


0.20 
  - original uBITX software (Ashhar Farhan)
