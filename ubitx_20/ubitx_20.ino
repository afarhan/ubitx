 *
 * This verision uses a built-in Si5351 library
 * Most source code are meant to be understood by the compilers and the computers.
 * Code that has to be hackable needs to be well understood and properly documented.
 * Donald Knuth coined the term Literate Programming to indicate code that is written be
 * easily read and understood.
 *
 * The Raduino is a small board that includes the Arduin Nano, a 16x2 LCD display and
 * an Si5351a frequency synthesizer. This board is manufactured by Paradigm Ecomm Pvt Ltd
 *
 * To learn more about Arduino you may visit www.arduino.cc.
 *
 * The Arduino works by starts executing the code in a function called setup() and then it
 * repeatedly keeps calling loop() forever. All the initialization code is kept in setup()
 * and code to continuously sense the tuning knob, the function button, transmit/receive,
 * etc is all in the loop() function. If you wish to study the code top down, then scroll
 * to the bottom of this file and read your way up.
 *
 * Below are the libraries to be included for building the Raduino
 * The EEPROM library is used to store settings like the frequency memory, caliberation data,
 * callsign etc .
 *
 *  The main chip which generates upto three oscillators of various frequencies in the
 *  Raduino is the Si5351a. To learn more about Si5351a you can download the datasheet
 *  from www.silabs.com although, strictly speaking it is not a requirment to understand this code.
 *  Instead, you can look up the Si5351 library written by xxx, yyy. You can download and
 *  install it from www.url.com to complile this file.
 *  The Wire.h library is used to talk to the Si5351 and we also declare an instance of
 *  Si5351 object to control the clocks.

    We no longer use the standard SI5351 library because of its huge overhead due to many unused
    features consuming a lot of program space. Instead of depending on an external library we now use
    Jerry Gaffke's, KE7ER, lightweight standalone mimimalist "si5351bx" routines (see further down the
    code). Here are some defines and declarations used by Jerry's routines:

/**
 * We need to carefully pick assignment of pin for various purposes.
 * There are two sets of completely programmable pins on the Raduino.
 * First, on the top of the board, in line with the LCD connector is an 8-pin connector
 * that is largely meant for analog inputs and front-panel control. It has a regulated 5v output,
 * ground and six pins. Each of these six pins can be individually programmed
 * either as an analog input, a digital input or a digital output.
 * The pins are assigned as follows (left to right, display facing you):
 *      Pin 1 (Violet), A7, SPARE
 *      Pin 2 (Blue),   A6, KEYER (DATA)
 *      Pin 3 (Green), +5v
 *      Pin 4 (Yellow), Gnd
 *      Pin 5 (Orange), A3, PTT
 *      Pin 6 (Red),    A2, F BUTTON
 *      Pin 7 (Brown),  A1, ENC B
 *      Pin 8 (Black),  A0, ENC A
 *Note: A5, A4 are wired to the Si5351 as I2C interface
 *       *
 * Though, this can be assigned anyway, for this application of the Arduino, we will make the following
 * assignment
 * A2 will connect to the PTT line, which is the usually a part of the mic connector
 * A3 is connected to a push button that can momentarily ground this line. This will be used for RIT/Bandswitching, etc.
 * A6 is to implement a keyer, it is reserved and not yet implemented
 * A7 is connected to a center pin of good quality 100K or 10K linear potentiometer with the two other ends connected to
 * ground and +5v lines available on the connector. This implments the tuning mechanism

 * The Raduino board is the size of a standard 16x2 LCD panel. It has three connectors:
 *
 * First, is an 8 pin connector that provides +5v, GND and six analog input pins that can also be
 * configured to be used as digital input or output pins. These are referred to as A0,A1,A2,
 * A3,A6 and A7 pins. The A4 and A5 pins are missing from this connector as they are used to
 * talk to the Si5351 over I2C protocol.
 *
 * Second is a 16 pin LCD connector. This connector is meant specifically for the standard 16x2
 * LCD display in 4 bit mode. The 4 bit mode requires 4 data lines and two control lines to work:
 * Lines used are : RESET, ENABLE, D4, D5, D6, D7
